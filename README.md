# eCommerce-Data-Break-Down
Hello, 
I have done this Ecommerce project to fetch insights from Data using MySql. I have make PowerBI dash board as well to visualized the Data Insights.
I have done this Ecommerce project to fetch insights from Data. The data was not cleaned and proper formatted so I did some editing in Excel to make it more readable.
Than, I imported the data to the MySql and wrote queries to derive reports and tables. 
I have use different advanced concept like windows functions, common table expression, CASE Statement etc. 
I have make some stored procedures so it can be use in future to derive specific information. I have also make some views so it can be use in quires. 
I have make interactive dash board using PowerBi where you can make changes according to the information you need.
